yesod-ng
========
Interaction between Yesod and AngularJS.

# Synopsis
This is an attempt at capturing the Yesod philosophy of using
type-safe routes for client apps written in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). 

# Features
 - Type-safe deep links.
 - Type-safe ansynchronous retrieval of view templates ("partials") from the running Yesod app.
 - some Template Haskell to ease definition of clients, but not enough as of yet.
 
# Stability
This is work in progress, and the API is unstable for the time being.
